The plan is to make the turret turn slowly, but obviouslty faster than the plane at typical distance

thre will be a guide that follows the same mechanics as the bullet meaning it is easy to tell where the bullet will be fired

planes need to fly, have collision etc.

the ground needs to be interactable so planes dont fall through it
